        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-6">Science Stream After 10th</h1>
        <p class="mb-4">Science stream offers you a perfect mix of practical concepts and scientific theories that ultimately builds analytical problem-solving skills. Understanding the various concepts of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology; will help you have a better idea about a bunch of natural and artificial processes around us. With the advancement of technology, many unique fields have sprung from science, such as Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, Bioinformatics, Mechatronics, and many more. Along with these, the traditional ones like Medicine, Engineering, Pharmaceuticals, Computer Science, and Forensic Science are also prevalent among the students.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Science Stream Boards Available in India</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">The majority of the schools in India offer 4 main boards of education. The difficulty level, as well as the curriculum of all the boards, vary from one another. As per your aptitude level and after analyzing the difficulty level of the particular board, you should opt for one along with the science stream. Listed below are the major board options that you can choose along with the science stream after 10th –</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li>CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education)</li>
            <li>ICSE (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education)</li>
            <li>IB (International Baccalaureate)</li>
            <li>State Boards</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Should I Take Science after 10th?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">For all the students who are confused in choosing the science stream, the question- ‘why should I take science after 10th’ remains to be a common one. Listed below are a few pointers that may help you find an answer to this question-</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li>Getting familiar with subjects like Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics will equip you with greater knowledge of natural phenomena happening in nature.</li>
            <li>The field tends to develop a practical approach within the students.</li>
            <li>Science stream is an easy gateway towards Research and Development.</li>
            <li>Combining Maths with subjects like Physics, Chemistry and Biology opens doors to many unique diploma and professional courses in Management.</li>
            <li>Opting for science stream can also give you a chance of studying at top universities like IIT, VIT, NIT, DTU, IIIT, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Science Stream After 10th: Subjects</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Before we go on to understand what are the subjects in the science stream after the 10th, a major point to note is that it offers 2 substreams. Non-medical and Medical are the 2 substreams available. If you want to pursue a career in science but not in Medicine, you can opt for a Non-medical stream. On the other hand, if you are certain of kick-starting a career in medicine, you should choose the Medical stream.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">You will be presented with Physics, Chemistry, and Biology (PCB) if you opt for the medical stream. However, Mathematics remains optional. For those choosing non-medical; Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics (PCM) are the mandatory subjects. The non-medical students can choose one more mandatory subject as per their choice. English/Hindi is a compulsory subject for both fields.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Science Stream after 10th Subjects</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Now let us understand in detail what these subjects entail-</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium bg-blue-100 p-2 rounded mb-2">Physics</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Physics is defined as the study of the structure of matter and how the tiny particles of the universe interact. The curriculum of Physics for class 11th and 12th focus on the topics like motion in a straight line, units of measurements, thermodynamics, kinetic energy, waves and oscillation, laws of motion, motion in a plane, gravitation, mechanical properties of fluids, thermal properties of matter and solids, laws of motion.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium bg-blue-100 p-2 rounded mb-2">Chemistry</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Class 11th and 12th Chemistry will no longer only revolve around chemical reactions. During these years, you will be taken through various in-depth theories based on molecules, the structure of atoms, and chemical equations. Alongside these topics, many new topics like equilibrium, hydrogen, classification of elements, hydrocarbons, periodicity properties, redox reaction, e-block and p-block elements, thermodynamics, organic chemistry, and states of matter.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium bg-blue-100 p-2 rounded mb-2">Mathematics</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Considered one of the most difficult subjects in classes 11th and 12th, mathematics needs your time and dedication through the journey. Initially, the concepts of this subject will require more focus but, with time you can develop a better hold over the subject. Here are some of the important chapters trigonometric functions, relations and functions, straight lines, linear inequalities, permutations and combinations, probability, statistics, mathematical reasoning, quadratic equations, binomial theorem, conic sections, mathematical induction, limits, and derivatives, and three-dimensional geometry.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium bg-blue-100 p-2 rounded mb-2">Biology</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Biology’s curriculum of these classes will open doors to a new world of the living! The core of class 11th will be Botany, whereas, class 12th will focus on Zoology. The chapters for the 11th and 12th can be numbered, but the study of Biology will be vast. Following are the chapter you must be studying during these years living world, plant and animal kingdom, biological classification, gases, body fluids, excretory products, morphology and anatomy of flowering plants, cells, biomolecules, mineral nutrition, plant respiration, growth and development, chemical coordination.</p>
